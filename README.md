# Panic-Button

An easier, modern approach to classroom dynamics to enable both students and teachers.

# Installing the Android App

Download our repository to your desired location on your machine.

Navigate to https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html, download the installer for Android Studio.

Run the installer and select the default options during the installation process, if you don't have an Android device to run the application on, choose to install the virtual emulator to run it on your machine.

Once the installer is finished, start Android Studio, choose to open an existing project, and open our project by selecting .../panic-button/src/androidApp/Don'tPanicEducational wherever the repository was placed. After Android Studio has finished opening the project click the run symbol near the top of Android Studio, it looks like a green arrow, and select your method of running the app by either the emulator or an Android device that is connected to your machine via USB and select ok.
