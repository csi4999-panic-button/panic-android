    <string name="textView_aboutUsMessage">Don\'t Panic was created by Matt Li, Dan Dyla, Tom
    Carrio, and Chase Ehlert. This application was developed to combat the problem of students
    not participating in the classroom enough. With Don\'t Panic the team hopes to engage students
    more in the lecture while making the process of asking the professor a question more efficient.</string>
